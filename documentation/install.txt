to get intelliskript working on another account i am doing these steps:
- disable intelliskript extension if you have it installed
- open github desktop
- add -> clone repository... i select intelliskript (you can using URL)
- startup vs code
- open folder -> the repo folder (user/github/intelliskript)
- terminal -> new terminal
- npm install
- run generate addon files from the debug configuration
- start debugging by running the web extension from the debug configuration
- open the 'test-data' folder in the new vscode window that pops up
- open a random .sk file inside of it
- syntax will get highlighting after like 5-10 seconds
